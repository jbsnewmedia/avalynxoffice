# Project Instructions

## Runtime and tooling

- Run Composer, Node, and all project tools inside Docker.
- Use the `avalynxoffice-web-1` container, the `application` user, and `/app` as the working directory.
- Prefer commands in this form:
    - `docker exec --user=application -w /app avalynxoffice-web-1 bash -lc "<command>"`
- Without the compose stack, use the published dev image
  `jbsnewmedia/avalynxoffice-dev` (built from `Dockerfile.dev`, ships the
  dev dependencies and the composer-bin tooling). Run as uid 1000
  (`application`) — permission-based tests cannot pass as root:
    - `docker run --rm --user 1000:1000 --entrypoint /bin/bash --network <db-network> -v "$PWD":/app -w /app -e DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/my_database?serverVersion=16" jbsnewmedia/avalynxoffice-dev -lc "php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction && composer test"`
    - Inside the image (without a mount) the schema must be migrated once as well:
      `docker run --rm --user 1000:1000 --entrypoint /bin/bash --network <db-network> -e DATABASE_URL="..." jbsnewmedia/avalynxoffice-dev -lc "php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction && vendor-bin/phpunit/vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration=phpunit-no-coverage.xml.dist"`

## Installing dependencies

- When installing code quality tools with Composer, use:
    - `COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer install`

## Required project commands

- PHPStan:
    - `composer bin-phpstan`
    - Do not add exclusions or ignore rules.
    - Do not use stubs.
- PHPUnit:
    - `composer test-coverage`
    - Maintain **100% code coverage** for classes, methods, and lines.
    - Do not add exclusions or ignore rules.
    - Do not use stubs.
- ECS:
    - `composer bin-ecs-fix`
- Rector:
    - `composer bin-rector-process`

## Test data flow

- PHPUnit tests must generate their own data for each test run.
- For integration and functional tests, the database must be rebuilt in `setUp()` and then freshly populated using `AppFixtures`.
- No test may assume that fixture data from a previous test or from a manually prepared database is still available.
